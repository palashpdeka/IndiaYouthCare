				<span>Are we wealthy or not?</span><br>
				Despite having access to every luxury, you still yearn for more. Is that bad? Okay, no. Simply put, we
				are miserable beings. Our lives have been plagued by a wealth of anxiety, despair, procrastination, and
				sloth as well as a poverty of happiness. You would be taken advantage of by life until you realise that
				being happy is more essential than making a ton of money.
			</p>

			<p class="mental-health-para para-sub">
				<span>Therefore, where is the exit?</span><br>
				Take a break, do yoga, listen to music, meditate, have a massage, or study relaxation methods, suggests a psychologist. But the memory that makes us depressed is still there. While some of the above advise may be truly helpful, but doing so without the right direction results in us simply experiencing momentary alleviation. But when night comes, we think about those hardships once again.
